# Identification-of-Crops-using-Residual-Neural-Network

Crop identification is a critical task in the field of agriculture, as it enables farmers and researchers to monitor and manage crops, estimate yields, and detect diseases. Accurate and efficient crop identification is essential for improving crop management practices and increasing yields. In recent years, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great promise in crop identification.
However, most existing studies have focused on identifying a single type of crop. In this study, we propose the use of residual neural network (ResNet) for identifying multiple types of crops based on their visual features. ResNet is a type of deep neural network that has been shown to be effective in image classification tasks.
Our study focuses on identifying five different types of crops: wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, and cotton. These crops were chosen as they are among the most commonly grown crops globally and have significant economic and nutritional value. We trained the ResNet on a large dataset of images of different crops and evaluated its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
The main contribution of our study is to demonstrate that ResNet can accurately identify multiple types of crops with high precision and recall. This approach has the potential to improve crop management practices, enable precision agriculture, and ultimately increase crop yields. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review of crop identification using deep learning. Section 3 describes the dataset and methodology used in our study. Section 4 presents our experimental results, and Section 5 provides a discussion of our findings. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and future work.
